[The History of Byzantium](https://thehistoryofbyzantium.com/) podcast [episode index](https://miranche.github.io/byzantium/episode-index.html) and utilities creating it.

A revamp and an update of the [old episode index](http://www.sal.wisc.edu/~jwp/thob/thob-episode-index.html) compiled by listener JP ([Jeffrey W Percival](http://www.sal.wisc.edu/~jwp/) of the University of Wisconsin Astronomy Department), stale since 2022. Shared on GitHub so anyone can take it over if I go off the radar.

The single non-UI piece of code here is the Python script [makeindex/makeindex.py](https://github.com/miranche/byzantium/blob/main/makeindex/makeindex.py) which scrapes the podcast website and generates the index. It works in tandem with an index template or a partly created index webpage. See copious comments in both Python and HTML about how it works. Other than that, the webpage got a facelift to be more in line with HTML5 standards and to appear more uniformly across browsers.

Regarding licensing, GNU GPL essentially applies only to the Python script. The rest is included under fair use / as-is / abandonware terms. Namely, all the images in the [images/](https://github.com/miranche/byzantium/tree/main/images) subdirectory are mirrored from the [Adventure Journal WordPress theme](https://themesinfo.com/adventure-journal-wordpress-theme-e3t), which has been developed as "open source" and then [decomissioned](https://web.archive.org/web/20150318062344/http://www.contextureintl.com/open-source/) by Contexture International. The HTML and style files are derived from the theme and the original index, which didn't specify any licensing. Some look-and-feel styling for the collapsible panel, but no more, is derived from [Adobe's Spry](https://github.com/adobe/Spry) [collapsible panel widget](https://opensource.adobe.com/Spry/articles/data_api/apis/collapsible_panel.html). All the rage in 2007, now provided by Adobe as-is and supposedly "open source" yet under full copyright, go figure. The JavaScript for opening and closing the collapsible elements is taken almost verbatim from [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/how-to-animate-the-details-element/).

The banner artwork was [designed by Amy Reilly](https://thehistoryofbyzantium.com/2018/12/03/brilliant-new-artwork-by-amy-reilly/). It's not mirrored here but included directly from The History of Byzantium site.

Enjoy playing with the collapsible accordion widget and (much more importantly) listening to the podcast.
